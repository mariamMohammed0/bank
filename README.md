# bank
This is our first GUI project to apply the oop principles .
It is a bank system where you can have an account or a VIP one, check your balance, make a withdrawal(even if you have no enough balance), 
view previous transaction, transfer amount of money to another account and check if you are in debt or not(You have a certain period of time to get the money back before you are considered indebted).  

The VIP account has privileges over other regular accounts.
