# bank
This is our first GUI project to apply the oop principles .
It is a bank system where you can have an account or a VIP one, check your balance, make a withdrawal(even if you have no enouph balance), 
view previous transaction, transfer amount of money to another acount and check if you are in debt or not(you have a certain period to return the money back before you are in debt).  

The VIP account has privileges over other regular accounts.
